From this folder, the necessary files are: 

- config.vhd: contains the minimal configuration for a Leon3 on DE2-115

- leon3mp.vhd: is the modified top level, which includes top_wrapper (a.k.a. top_level) 
	       component and removes unused pins

- top_level.vhd: is the component needed to interface Leon3 bus and Avalon

NOTE:

- config.vhd and config_DE2-115.vhd are identical

- the .h and .in files have been copied just for safety, but they are not necessary
