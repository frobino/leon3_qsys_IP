/*-------------------------------------------------------------*/
Tested environment: 
Linux Debian Jessie x64, with Quartus 13.1 
Linux Ubuntu 14.04 x64, with Quartus 14.0 and 10.0sp1
Other environments/OSs have not been tested

The script described in step 5 has been written for grlib version 1.3.7-b4144. 
If another version is used some simple modifications have to been applied. 
/*-------------------------------------------------------------*/

Steps to generate the project after cloning this repository:

1) Unpack the Leon SoC tool (grlib-gpl-1.3.7-b4144.tar.gz) in the "root" folder of the repo, 
   so that the final folder structure looks as the following:

   ./
   .grlib-gpl-1.3.7-b4144/
   .reference_files/
   .test_gpio2/

2) cd grlib-gpl-1.3.7-b4144/designs/leon3-terasic-de2-115
   make xconfig

3) From the GUI, select "Load configuration from file", and select the 
   config.h file provided in the reference_files/ folder. 
   The select "Save and exit"
   NOTE: unfortunately this step does not always work. 
   To be safe, I suggest to copy the config.vhd provided in 
   in the reference_files/ folder to the 
   grlib-gpl-1.3.7-b4144/designs/leon3-terasic-de2-115 folder.

4) Control that the config.vhd file in grlib-gpl-1.3.7-b4144/designs/leon3-terasic-de2-115/ 
   looks the same as reference_files/config.vhd.
   In particular, check the following properties:

-- AHB ROM
  constant CFG_AHBROMEN : integer := 1;
  constant CFG_AHBROPIP : integer := 0;
  constant CFG_AHBRODDR : integer := 16#000#;
  constant CFG_ROMADDR : integer := 16#100#;
  constant CFG_ROMMASK : integer := 16#E00# + 16#100#;
-- AHB RAM
  constant CFG_AHBRAMEN : integer := 1;
  constant CFG_AHBRSZ : integer := 64;
  constant CFG_AHBRADDR : integer := 16#400#;

5) enter in test_gpio2/ folder and run the .sh script. 
   The script does the following: 
   
   1 - copy top_level.vhd from reference_files/ folder to 
       grlib-gpl-1.3.7-b4144/designs/leon3-terasic-de2-115/ folder

   2 - copy the leon3mp.vhd file from reference_files/ folder to 
       grlib-gpl-1.3.7-b4144/designs/leon3-terasic-de2-115/ folder. 
       This file includes the top_level component and removes the undused pins. 
       (the best would be modifying )
       In this case, leon3mp.vhd (the top level of the Leon component), 
       has been edited manually to include the amba_avalon wrapper (top_level.vhd). 
       and must be modified to remove useless pins. THEORETICALLY, if the amba_avalon 
       wrapper is inserted as new component in grlib (grlib.pdf p.73), 
       this is done automatically, but now this is done manually (or through the .sh script)

   3 - rename config, leon3mp and top_level files to avoid problems with components called 
       in the same way from grlib-gpl-1.3.7-b4144/lib folder

6) Now we can create a quartus project (named test_gpio) in the test_gpio2/ folder, and 
   use the .qsys file as top component. Generate and synthesize, to create the .sof file. 

   NOTE: DOUBLE CHECK THAT THE .qsf FILE IS NOT OVERWRITTEN!

7) Cross compile the software program using the sparc-elf cross compiler 

   sparc-elf-gcc -msoft-float -c -O2 <.c file>

8) Run the grmon debugger. 
   NOTE: grmon is officially supported only for x86 architectures. 
   This means that if we want to connect though the altera jtag (altjtag) 
   we require the libraries (.so files ) from a older version of 
   Quartus than 14.0. I tested with libraries from 10.0sp1. 
 
   Be sure that your shell is running a Nios shell, then set the 
   following environment variables:

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path to grmon>/grmon-eval-2.0.52/linux/lib
   For Quartus 10.0 to 13.1 included: 
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path to altera>/altera/13.1/quartus/linux 

   To open the grmon shell opens correctly: 
   grmon-eval -altjtag -u

   In the grmon shell, give the following commands:
   lo <exacutable-name>
   run
